[Processing](http://www.processing.org) is an open source language and development environment, based on Java that makes it easier to create artistic/ interactive environments and on a more platform free basis.

[Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/) is an open source tool written in Java to make it easier for students and researchers around the world to try different machine learning algorithms on their own data.

Wekaizing is a library for Processing that makes it easy for people with little or no background in Machine Learning to use Weka for their Generative Art projects.

Download the correct file for your operating system, and extract the directory within to your Processing libraries folder. The examples in the project go through the things that are implemented.
